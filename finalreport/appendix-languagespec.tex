\section{Specification of the logic description language}
  The logic description language is described by EBNF definition in
  \lstlistingname~\ref{lst:ebnf}. It is noted that since a high
  flexibility was incorporated into the grammar by specifying device
  types as a capital string (instead of a list of string literals of
  recognized devices), there was no need to change the grammar
  (hence no need to change the parser) when additional devices were
  added during the maintenance phase.
